Our fully accredited campus health service, the University Health Service, has been in close contact with the Allegheny Department of Health (ACHD) to discuss best management practices for this situation on the Pittsburgh campus and is carefully monitoring the situation. When students come to the clinic for help, UHS staff will carefully screen the students for potential coronavirus symptoms. The school will also send a campus-wide email later today to encourage students who may experience symptoms to seek care. According to direct guidance from the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the chief epidemiologist of the Allegheny Health Bureau, there are currently no instructions regarding the need to universally isolate all students based on their origin or travel location.\nThe University will continue to update if there are new changes to our management methods or the directives of the Department of Health or the CDC. Students with any concerns are encouraged to contact UHS for assistance. They can call UHS at 412-268-2157 or visit their website www.cmu.edu/health-services for information on medical advice, appointments, and business hours.
